# Notes

## Sanad

* `clearSanad` make sanad an empty manual sanad and it can be used by user again

## Factor
* after creating / updating factor you should call `factor.sync` to sync factor items and factor expenses
* factor doesn't effect inventory until you definite it or call `DefiniteFactor.updateFactorInventory` (you should call that with `revert=True` before updating a factor)
* before updating a factor you should verify items by `factor.verify_items` method by passing items data and item ids to delete to it. 
Verifying means for each item check if it changed or not, if we have newer items on it's ware raise an exception
